# Energy Usage Forecasting with ARIMA
 
This project is a case study that explores and analyzes existing data to predict energy consumption and identify trends through ARIMA modeling. 
The goal is to forecast energy usage accurately, enabling better energy management and optimization.

## Data Analysis
 
The project uses data analysis libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to explore and analyze large datasets. 
The dataset used in this project contains historical energy consumption data from a power station, and it is first cleaned and preprocessed before being used in the model. 
The preprocessing steps include data normalization, filling missing values, and data transformation.

## Model Training and Optimization
 
The project uses scikit-learn to train machine learning models and optimize hyperparameters using techniques such as cross-validation. The foundational machine learning algorithm used in this project is Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) for time series forecasting.
ARIMA is a popular model used in time series forecasting, and it works by modeling the autocorrelation in the data to make future predictions. The model is trained on the preprocessed data, and its hyperparameters are optimized to achieve better performance.

## Results
The trained ARIMA model accurately predicts energy usage for the given time period, and the results are visualized using Matplotlib. The model's predictions are also compared to the actual energy usage, and the performance metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), are calculated to evaluate the model's performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of ARIMA modeling for energy usage forecasting, which can be useful in energy management and optimization. The project uses various data analysis and machine learning techniques to preprocess data, train models, and optimize hyperparameters. The trained model's performance is evaluated using performance metrics, and the results are visualized for better understanding.
